# Attrition_Analysis

I successfully conducted data analytics on the Attrition dataset, exploring various features and patterns. Subsequently, I employed a decision tree classification model to predict attrition, leveraging insights gained from the data analysis. The decision tree model provided valuable predictions and insights that can contribute to a better understanding of attrition factors within the dataset.
